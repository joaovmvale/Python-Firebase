This repository contains my personal project where I communicate to a ESP32 board via API, I built this program to make easier the process of creating new objects on the database.

## Project idea 🤖
This project it's basically a display connected to a ESP32 board, this display only shows the current date and a phrase from the Firebase database. The board contains a python code where reads and show the phrase on the display.

## Problem and Solution 🔨
To insert new phrases on the database I had to manually access and write the index and the phrase above the last existed, It was so annoying so I've decided to create a program that uses the Firebase API to manage this database. Now, with this program I just have to write the new phrase and all the job it's made in the background, I don't even have to open the navigator.

## How to run ⚙️
To protect my personal database I didn't share my personal key, but if you want to use this project, just fill your database credentials on the code and enjoy it! :D
